## Technologies Used

* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _Bootstrap_
* _JS_
* _jQuery_
* _Github_

## Description/Goals

_Build a page with a form containing input fields where users may enter several of their favorite things._
_Then, write code that gathers each of these form input values and places them into one array._
_After this is done, use your site to practice targeting and moving elements between arrays:_
_Use square bracket notation to access the second, first, and third elements of the original array of favorite things._
_Then, use push() to add only these elements to a brand new array._
_Finally, display this new array in your page's HTML as list items in a <ul> tag._


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _git clone **repository link**, to your local machine._
* _requires an internet connection to run (Bootstrap and jQuery are using a CDN)_
* _open the index.html file in your browser, or run Go Live in VS Code to run the code on your local host._
